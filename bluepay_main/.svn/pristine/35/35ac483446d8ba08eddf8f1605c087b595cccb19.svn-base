UPRADE NOTES :::

v 2.2 BETA
â€” Testing new payments form and receipt form 

v 2.1

-- More options in control panel to control your Module URL and also Account, Key, and Mode information without having to alter any of this in program.

-- We now have the Default Results (Return Receipt) method for sending data to your trans_notify.php file working.
This allows instant class entry into Moodle if payment has been Authorized and accepted by Bluepay, rather then having to wait for their slower TRANS NOTIFY method.

-- Next version should have both methods (TRANS NOTIFY and Return Receipt) working with ability to switch preference between the two.
